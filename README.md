This is my version of the Racebox Mini emulator.

I wanted to build a device to measure my course run times and track the distance covered.
I had an ESP32-WROOM module on hand and needed to connect a BMI160 sensor instead of the one specified in the original design. 
Additionally, my RushFPV module supported GNSS v3 rather than v2.
I am not very experienced in programming, so I spent a few hours using Grok and ChatGPT to modify the code to work with my specific modules; the device wouldn't function without these changes. 
For standalone operation, I added an 18650 battery along with a TP4060 board for charging and battery protection. I also designed a 3D-printable case to house all the components and included a power switch.





























# Open Source RaceBox Mini Emulator
> **Disclaimer:** This project is independent and open-source. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected to RaceBox. The name “RaceBox Mini” is used only to describe compatibility.

## Overview

This project provides firmware for an ESP32-based device that acts as a high-performance GPS/IMU Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) broadcaster. It integrates a U-blox GNSS module for precise position, velocity, and timing data at 25Hz, along with an MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope for motion sensing.

The device is designed to be housed in a custom 3D-printed enclosure, with design files included in this repository.

## Features

- **High-Resolution GPS Data**: Achieves 25Hz update rate using a U-blox GNSS module.  
- **Multi-Constellation Support**: Leverages GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, and BeiDou for enhanced accuracy and reliability.  
- **Integrated IMU**: Captures 3-axis accelerometer (`±8g`) and 3-axis gyroscope (`±500 deg/s`) data from the MPU6050.  
- **Real-time BLE Streaming**: Transmits a custom 88-byte data packet containing comprehensive GNSS and IMU information over BLE.  
- **Automatic Configuration**: Robust GPS initialization.
- **Custom RaceBox Protocol**: Data is encapsulated in a UBX-like custom protocol for efficient transmission.  
- **3D Printable Enclosure**: Includes design files for a compact and protective case.

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

To build this project, you'll need the following components:

- **ESP32 Development Board**: (https://a.co/d/fTThpTl)  
- **U-blox GNSS Module**: 
  * MG-902 - https://a.co/d/b6DcUS6 
  * SAM-M10Q - https://a.co/d/54zrba3
  * MG-903 - https://a.co/d/fxp2tLk 
  * HGLRC M100-5883 - https://a.co/d/47V0TqJ
  * AERO SELFIE M10G-5883L- https://a.co/d/cmYLjBP (Theoretically works but I dont have it)
    
  Any M10 based U-blox modules should work, the output rate may vary but you should be able to get 25hz with just GPS enabled. But YMMV.
  
- **MPU6050 Accelerometer/Gyroscope Module**: (https://a.co/d/dCMwffg or similar)  
- **24AWG Hook-up Wire/Jumper Wires** or just use the wiring that comes with GNSS module, its perfect for this application.
- **M3x6 Screws** (2)    
- **Soldering Iron & Solder**
- **USB-C or Micro-USB Cable** (Depending on your ESP32 board, But USB-C all the things)  
- **3D Printer & ABS Filament**  

The electronics should cost under 40$.

### Prepare the 3D Printed Case

- You shouldn't need any post processing of the printed parts but make sure the buttons slide smoothly in the holes in the lid

### Enclose the Electronics

- Mount the MPU6050 module using M3 screws
![image info](Images/Accelerometer_mount.jpg "Wiring Guide")
- Place the ESP32 in the slot  
- Route cables neatly
![image info](Images/Wiring%20Guide.jpg "Wiring Guide")
- Close the case carefully, it should click together. Make sure none of the wires are pinched or in the way of the buttons

## Firmware Setup and Upload

### 1. Install Arduino IDE

Download from the [official Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

### 2. Install ESP32 Board Support

- Open Arduino IDE Preferences  
- In “Additional Board Manager URLs” add: 
    - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json

### 3. Install Libraries:
- Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries... and install the following:
    - Adafruit MPU6050
    - Adafruit Unified Sensor
    - SparkFun u-blox GNSS Arduino Library (ensure it's version 2)

### 4. Open the Sketch: 
- Open the esp32_racebox_mini_emulator.ino in the Arduino IDE.
    - Configure Board Settings:
    - Go to Tools > Board and select your specific ESP32 board (e.g., "ESP32 Dev Module").
    - Ensure the correct Upload Speed and Port are selected.

### 5. Configure Firmware


* Update the GNSS constellations to use(lines 26-31).
  * For the SAM-M10Q module, I recommend using GPS and one local one, Galilieo should work great in most places. Selecting too many constellations can cause the update frequency to drop from 25Hz.
  * For the MG-902 module, you can select up to 4 constellations but it doesnt really make it more accurate than the SAM-M10Q module, but it doesnt appear to drop its frequency either, so might as well.

  https://app.qzss.go.jp/GNSSView/gnssview.html This could help you pick which constellations to pick.

* **OPTIONAL** – You may update the **10-digit number** in the `deviceName` on **line 33** to personalize your device.

    * **ID Limit:** If you intend to use this with the RaceBox App, The number must be **less than 4000000000**. The RaceBox app will not connect to devices with an ID of 4000000000 or higher.

    * **Prefix Requirement:** Make sure to **keep** the `"RaceBox Mini "` prefix unchanged—only change the numbers.

      ✅ **Correct:**
      `String deviceName = "RaceBox Mini 3999999999";`
    
      ❌ **Incorrect (Prefix changed):**
      `String deviceName = "MY GPS 6942069420";`
    
      ❌ **Incorrect (Number too high):**
      `String deviceName = "RaceBox Mini 4000000000";`


### 6. Upload the Firmware


* Click the **Upload** button (the right arrow icon) in the Arduino IDE to compile and upload the code to your ESP32.

  * If upload fails, try this sequence while the output shows "Connecting....":

    1. Hold the **BOOT** button
    2. Press and release the **EN** button
    3. Then release the **BOOT** button

* Open the **Serial Monitor** to verify startup. Initialization is complete when you see:

  BLE Packet Rate: 0.00 Hz | GNSS Update Rate: 25.00 Hz

  printed every 5 seconds.

## 3D Printed Enclosure

The repository includes `*.3mf` files for the custom 3D-printed enclosure designed specifically for the components in the BOM.

* 1x Base file.(either the GoPro mount version or the basic one to use with velcro)
* 1x Lid depending on the the type of GPS module you have.
* 2x Buttons (If you print a lid that supports buttons)
* 1x axdl_mount

Theres a Accelerometer blank included if you have a different accelerometer to create your own mount.

### Recommended Print Settings:

* **Material:** ABS (for durability and heat resistance, especially if used in a car)
* **Layer Height:** 0.2mm
* **Infill:** 15-20% (for sufficient strength)
* **Nozzle Temperature:** (Refer to your filament manufacturer's recommendations)
* **Bed Temperature:** (Refer to your filament manufacturer's recommendations)

## Usage

Once the firmware is uploaded and the device is powered on:

1.  The ESP32 will start advertising a BLE service named "**RaceBox Mini 0123456789**"(the devicename you customized before uploading the firmware).
2.  Use a compatible BLE client application to connect to the device.
    - Tested compatible apps, theoretically anything that supports a racebox mini should work.
        - Solostorm (Android)
        - RaceChrono (Android)
        - RaceChrono Pro (Android/iOS)
        - NMEAconnect (iOS)
        - AutoX DL(iOS)
        - Racebox App (Android/iOS)
